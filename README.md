# webpack-boilerplate

This is a simple starter kit for bundling code for the browser with webpack. It includes a few loaders and a basic config for babel and eslint.

## Install dependencies

- `yarn`

## Use

- `yarn start` Start the app at `http://localhost:8080`, with Hot Module Replacement enabled.
- `yarn build` Bundle your code for production.

## Other branches

There are a couple other branches which you may find useful, depending on the needs of your project:

- [`react`](https://github.com/zgreen/webpack-boilerplate/tree/react) For React, use this.
- [`node`](https://github.com/zgreen/webpack-boilerplate/tree/node) For Node.js development, use this (this branch needs work).
